<h3><a name="overview">1. Study overview</a></h3>

<p>There is a substantial literature examining psychosocial
determinants of behavior change in relation to non-communicable disease, but
much less research has been devoted to understanding how populations react and respond
to communicable disease epidemics. Yet is it precisely these responses that can
potentially determine the overall impact of an epidemic by influencing risk-taking
and protective practices.</p>
 
<p>Our group has been conducting a series of population surveys in collaboration with
the <a href="https://www.sphpc.cuhk.edu.hk/">School of Public Health at CUHK</a>,
to study community responses before, during and after the first wave
of 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) locally, to determine disease
attack rates and use of healthcare services, and to
study the use of preventive measures, and how these might be affected
by individualsâ€™ attitudes towards influenza and their perception of
the risks they faced.</p>


<h3><a name="data">2. Raw data</a></h3>

<p>Raw data from our surveys is available to download as a zip file here:</p>
<ul class="circle">
  <li><a href="data/HKU_surveys_v1.csv" title="Hong
  Kong H1N1 surveys dataset version 1">HKU_surveys_v1.csv</a>
  <li><a href="data/survey_data_dictionary.xls" title="Hong
  Kong H1N1 surveys data dictionary version 1">survey_data_dictionary.xls</a>
</ul> 

<p>This version of the survey data contains all items included in our
first paper. Data on additional items included in our surveys will be
released at a later date.</p>

<p>We provide our data under the <a 
href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1-0/">Open 
Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License</a>, which is a version of open
access for data. Under this licence we reserve no rights: 
there are no restrictions on use of our data, and no requirement to cite
our work or this website. However we would anticipate that for academic purposes the
standard practice of referencing sources would apply. We would like to hear from 
researchers who are using our data and we would be keen to work together on analyses.</p>


<h3><a name="first">3. Overview of survey findings</a></h3>

<p>Our first manuscript, published in the Journal of Infectious
Diseases, describes the main results of 13 cross-sectional telephone
surveys conducted between April and November 2009. Overall we
identified no substantial changes in preventive measures through the
first wave of H1N1, suggesting that community measures may not have
played a substantial role in mitigating the epidemic impact. We also
explored the factors associated with the adoption of hygiene
behaviors, face mask use and social distancing.</p>

<p>Results presented in that manuscript are reproduced in the following scripts
which can be run in the free statistical software package

<p>We are continuing to analyze our survey data and further work is in
preparation. More details will follow later.</p>

<h3><a name="comment">A comment on reproducible research</a></h3>

<p>We fully support the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/EDE.0b013e318196784a">increasing calls</a>
from the academic community for 
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwj093" title="Peng et al., 2006, AJE">epidemiologic analyses to be reproducible</a>, as part of the wider scientific endeavour to
replicate results.
Another example of this recommendation is in the <a
href="http://www.qve-goodpracticeguide.org.uk/guide#TOC-2.4-Inputs">Good
Practice Guide for Quantitative Veterinary Epidemiology</a>. 
Here we have published the raw <em>anonymised</em> data from our telephone surveys. We have also published scripts which allow the analyses in our published papers to be reproduced.</p>

<p>Thousands of local people have given their time to answer our questions, in the
expectation that our research studies will add to public health knowledge and inform policy makers.
Participants are likely to expect that we will make the best possible use of the information that
we have collected about them in our studies. It would be difficult to argue that facilitating
best use of the data by the research community need not involve releasing raw data.</p>

<p>Publication of anonymised raw data has been approved by our local IRB and funding sources.
We anticipate that release of the raw data will:</p>
<ul class="circle">
 <li>Promote reproducibility of our results.
 <li>Allow other investigators to conduct their own analyses on our data.
 <li>Allow other investigators to compare our data with theirs, for
   example to explore similarities and differences between research findings.
 <li>Allow other investigators to prepare and plan for their own studies.
</ul>
